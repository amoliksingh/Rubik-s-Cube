Rubik's Cube Solver Project Files
Hi there! The Java files in this repository are based as classes which inherit from one another. 
The main Java file labelled TestCube.java is the file needed to run the solving algorithm.
The turing file is to simply input the faces of the cube.
I am still missing the arduino program and I am working on uploading it soon.
